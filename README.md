Hi all,

I started learning Java in the end of 2021, because I wanted to shift my career on a higher level, as I was bored being technical support or system administrator. Apart from it, it was an experiment to see if I can handle and if it suits me. It seems that I can and it does. So here I am, after spending dozens of hours on online course in Udemy and this task. I would like to code more and pottentially work as a developer.

Cheers
